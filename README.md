# React Native Boilerplate with Tailwind, ESLint, Zustand, and Screen Switch Support

This boilerplate provides a starting point for building React Native applications with Tailwind CSS, ESLint, Zustand for state management, and screen switch support. It aims to provide a structured and scalable setup for your React Native projects.

## Features

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) - A JavaScript framework for building mobile applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX.
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - A small, fast, and scalable state management library for React.
- Screen Switch Support - A preconfigured routing setup to switch between screens.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Package managers for Node.js.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sopheak8888/react-native-boilerplate-with-tailwind.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-native-boilerplate-with-tailwind
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install
   
    # Using Yarn
    yarn
    ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm start
    
    # Using Yarn
    yarn start
   
    # This will start the Metro Bundler, which serves the JavaScript bundle for your app.
   ```


5. Run the application on a physical or virtual device:

   ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run android
    
    # Using Yarn
    yarn android
   ```
   This will build and install the app on your device. If you prefer to run the app on an iOS device, use `npm run ios` or `yarn ios` instead.
